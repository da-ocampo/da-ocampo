                    <a href="./post-2.html" target="_blank" class="btn-mobile-only">View in webpage</a>                <p>For the past year and a half, I have been enrolled at Wake Technical Community College in their Web Development program for an associateâ€™s degree in applied science. Before my time there I knew the fundamentals of HTML &amp; CSS not having ventured into any other languages before the program. Most of the coursework in the program has been based on HTML &amp; CSS, while there were classes that had to do with languages such as C++ and PHP, a majority is HTML &amp; CSS. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, I feel like it does not capture enough of the most relevant knowledge you would need to thrive in an industry like this, especially since this course is not free.</p>
                    <p>An oddity of the program that shows how dated some of the material is, is the course on ASP.NET, a web application framework that has not been in active development since 2018. This was initially very confusing to me when starting the course until I realized that perhaps the program just has not had an update since 2018, which is still kind of concerning. I feel as though this course could have been replaced with something more useful, perhaps a JavaScript framework course, something popular in the job field like React or Next.JS would have been great choices.</p>
                    <p>Overall with the course material I have left (5 courses) I would have rathered the material in this program to be a lot more well-rounded and relevant to the current world of web development, due to the fact that this industry is constantly evolving and never slowing down, 4-5 years is equivalent to a decade.</p>
